                <h2 class="h2">Professional Achievment</h2>
                    <p class="p">My main professional achievement during this sprint was keeping calm and didn't panic too much as we entered into lockdown in the middle of this sprint. I created/followed better branching names for this sprint in GitHub. Getting started with online tutorials via <a href="https://www.webex.com/">Webex</a> was a challenge and new experience and a very good learning step as being an IT professional it is very important that you know how to manage remotely/virtually.</p><br><br>               
                <h2 class="h2">Technical Achievment:</h2>
                    <p class="p">As a team we all decided to use Discord as our communication source for our scrum meetings and client meetings. I have never used discord before. I installed <a href="https://discordapp.com/">Discord</a> on my laptop and learned how to use discord through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rILeDVyeGO4">Youtube</a> video. Before our team meeting I tried using it but I had problems with the microphone. Discord kept saying provide access to my microphone but on my laptop settings I have already approved the access. I searched online and looked into the drivers setting and added new driver. Once new driver was installed it started working. This was a new learning for me and now I know all about the windows drivers and since manage to <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214">update</a> all the drivers on my laptop and they are all up to date.<br> I also worked on Display on user home page, Data entry navigation and Return/GoBack buttons on all the pages where user should use this feature. I also added remember me button on the login page.</p><br>

                <h2 class="h2">Personal Reflection:</h2><br>   
                    <h3 class="h3">What did I do well?</h3>           
                        <p class="p">In our second sprint I made better communication with the team and the client. I shared my screen on discord with the team and client and elaborated what work I have done. As a team we did clear a lot of cards from our work log this sprint. I explained how it worked and asked the client if he was ok with the outcome and the client was quite pleased with the final outcome. I did discord meetings virtually. As the first half of the sprint was normal and second half was in lockdown, it was big challenge from not going to classes and learning everything online.</p><br>
                    <h3 class="h3">What could I have done better?</h3>           
                        <p class="p">More communication within the team about our scrum meetings. I logged in for the scrum meeting on discord but no one showed up. Our team productivity has gone down because of the lock down. I need to ask more questions if I don't understand or it's not clear on some aspects of the project. I think I need to learn and understand more about how GitHub branching and other aspects like conflicts and merging issues. I have a personal problem that I panic really quick and if I miss a little step I panic and make more mistakes. I also need to work on my patience as that can be a big factor in how I learn and put my leaning into work.</p><br><br>

                    <h3 class="h3">What lessons did I learn?</h3>           
                        <p class="p">My lesson from this sprint was that I needed to organize my time management better. Working full time and also looking after my family made it hard for me to follow time management this week. I need to make sure I put a plan towards as I will be working overtime while in my next sprint aswell. I will have to make sure that I do better in organising my schedule and work on a plan from there onwards. Keep myself motivated as my health starts to take its toll on me.</p><br>  
                    <h3 class="h3">What barriers did I encounter?</h3>           
                        <p class="p">This sprint I had a couple of barriers. As it was holidays, my work roster was changed into full time. Due to the Covid-19 issue, I was actually asked to help my work and end up doing overtime almost every day and had a 51-hour work week. It was very hard to concentrate on any studies. Most of my scrum meeting and client meeting occurred while I was at work. I changed my break schedule and covered all the meetings in my breaks. I made sure that I joined all the meetings, so it won't impact my team. Also after I downloaded discord my microphone wasn't working. My team mates tried to help me by advising to do certain steps but nothing worked. To make sure I do not affect any of the team members or the meetings, I end up using my laptop for the display and installed app on my iPhone so I could join the voice call.</p><br>
