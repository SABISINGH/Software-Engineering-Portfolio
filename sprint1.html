        <h2 class="h2">Professional Achievment</h2>
            <p class="p">Professional achievment is to attend all client meetings, team meetings and classes so that I can give my best effort towards the team and the paper. Personal achievement for me for this sprint would be the organization of our team and work allocation for everyone. I created most of the user stories/cards (issues) on our git hub project. Elise became our client, so we could start our first sprint. I asked everyone which task they feel comfortable with to work on as this is our first sprint and I wanted all the members to feel part of the team. I implemented my leadership skills by putting the team together and made sure everyone felt part of the team. I drew everyone's schedule/classes to figure out the time we all could make to the meeting as I felt everyone was slacking off a little. Everyone agreed to do our client meeting on Thursday. I organized the meeting with our client (Grayson). I attended the client meeting along with Roy as Issa & Jonas didn't make to the meeting. I made sure we asked our client all the questions. I wrote down all the things our clent wantd us to work on the app and sent it to everyone through facebook messenger. I also recorded the meeting (with clients approval) for the team and added on the messenger so the members who missed the meeting can hear what client's requirements are for the project. The activity we did in the class about how laravel works and watching the series videos on <a class="aa" href="https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-6-from-scratch">laravel from scratch</a> helped me refresh my memory.</p><br>

        <h2 class="h2">Technical Achievment</h2>
            <p class="p">As a technical achievement there was a lot to learn in this sprint as I had to start from the scratch. I learnt how to install PHP from <a href="https://windows.php.net/download">windows PHP</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">node.js</a> so I could install the <a href="https://getcomposer.org/?ref=morioh.com">composer</a> on my computer for laragon to work. Then I installed composer on my computer. Start of the sprint I followed instructions on the <a class="aa" href="https://moodle.op.ac.nz/course/view.php?id=6813">moodle laravel tutorial</a> while working on my checkpoint and deployed the project to work on. Later Elise advised in the class that we need to have our project working on the local machine. So as a team we decided we would install Laragon on our local machines. It was also recommended by other class mates. I installed Laragon on my laptop first in the class while other team mates watched and learnt the installation process. Followed instructions on the<a class="aa" href="https://laragon.org/docs/index.html"> laragon website</a> and instructions on <a class="aa" href="https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@riyo.s94/laragon-how-to-install-and-using-it-for-local-development">steemit</a> website I managed to install the Laragon on my local machine. Nick from my class also helped me with the database link and other permission commands. Next class Issa suggested me that I should not use the phpMyAdmin as it is linked with mariadb and we not using mariadb on our local machine and instead use the HeidiSQL database. He made some changes on my computer and changed it to HeidiSQl but that started throwing up issues for me. Checked with Elise and she advised she would prefer the phpMyAdmin so I changed it back to phpMyAdmin but I still encountered issues. We all tried solve it as a team but couldn't figure out. Then I looked at .env file and noticed that DB_database file was wrong. I changed it back to opstatschickenwings as thats what the database name was in phpMyAdmin and it worked from there onwards. Project wise we divided the issues in four. Myself and Jonas assigned everyone cards/Issues to work on for our first sprint. I worked on alcohol intake and snack intake. We had to make sure all the pages are working/functioning well. If there are any bugs then fix them and so that by our next sprint our website should functionally work. As per the pictures below I made changes to the public function update() and public function store() in alcohol and snack with min and max (the user cannot leave the field blank and also calories/kilojoules is not 0 or a very big figure) so the customer cannot put wrong entries. Also edited the required date to be before or equal to today so the user cannot chose future date.</p><br>

        <h2 class="h2">Personal Reflection</h2><br>   
            <h3 class="h3">What did I do well?</h3>           
                <p class="p">I have previously worked with Issa and Jonas together as a team in Web 1 final assignment. So I approached Issa and Jonas if they would like to make a team again for this project. I managed to communicate well and made a team of three. Later Roy became part of our team as he was added to our team by Elise as team size was 4-5. I communicated well with all my team members in our early meetings. I made sure Roy was also part of our team by kept asking him questions and getting his input in our conversations. As we have used the facebook messenger before as a team I suggested we should use facebook messenger again which whole team agreed to. I organized the client meetings.</p><br>
                <p class="img"><a><img border="1" src="proof/sprint1/IMG_2727.PNG" class="imgg" width="350px" height="300px"></a></p><br><br>
            <h3 class="h3">What could I have done better?</h3>           
                <p class="p">This was the start of our very first sprint, from here on almost everything I do needs to get better if not the same. We could have communicated better as a team as I was not prepared/ready for this sprint end. As a team we decided our sprint end would be Thursday but we had to end it earlier and my code wasn't pushed to Github.</p><br>
            <h3 class="h3">What lessons did I learn?</h3>           
                <p class="p">I will need to attend all the meetings so we as a team have a same understanding of client requirements. I need to be better prepared for our client meetings. I (team) will need a lot of good organizing skills and better communication within our team. Learn more about how to operate Github.</p><br>
            <h3 class="h3">What barriers did I encounter?</h3>           
                <p class="p">This was our first sprint and we all were getting used to the style and pattern of project. Barriers I could think of were one that I felt team wasn't too keen to meet outside the class time and I think that is a very big requirement if we want to do well in this project. Another barrier was our client meeting. If everyone was in the meeting then we could have asked more questions to our client. </p><br>
