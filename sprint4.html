                    <h2 class="h2">Professional Achievment</h2>
                        <p class="p">Professional achievement for me in this sprint was getting the password reset fully working. Previous sprint I had the email going out to the customer's email, but earn customer clicked the link it was going to page saying the site can't be reached. I watched a few videos and searched online and able to get it working. It was an achievement for me as I learned how the email token is sent to customers through the database and every time we send the forgot password reset the token changes. Also working through the vendor files and Learning how everything inside laravel works. I explained it in technical achievement below. As I wrote in my previous sprint that I was having merge conflicts, but was not confident enough to merge. I manage to sort my merge conflicts all By myself.</p><br><br>               
                    <h2 class="h2">Technical Achievment</h2>
                        <p class="p">I was asked by my client to get the password reset link working for this sprint. In my last sprint was able to send the reset password, email notification to the users provided email, but when they click the link it was showing site can't be reached or 404 not found. Some online forums suggested to add localhost: 8000 (image added below) in the link and it Should work. I asked for help from my team mates during our scrum meetings, but all three of them did not know how to implement this as they also have never worked on this issue before. By following the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-MK7Y3GDuQ">Youtube</a> video I managed to implement my learning into this task. I worked through vendor files as per images provided below and able to get the link coming back to the server. Users could now set up a new password if they have requested the reset password request. Now I had the layout issues as per the images below. I manage to fix them by tweaking a few settings in the layouts and view pages.</p><br>

                    <h2 class="h2">Personal Reflection</h2><br>   
                        <h3 class="h3">What did I do well?</h3>           
                        <p class="p">Getting the forgot password working by following instructions from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-MK7Y3GDuQ">Youtube</a>. Finally getting my mind out from the thinking of I can't solve merge conflicts, thinking I will stuff something else. I finally followed what Elise taught me that I need to be confident in myself and Achieve the things I am not confident in. This is the place I need to learn and if I break some code she is there to help me. By following <a href="https://github.com/githubteacher/github-for-developers-sept-2015/issues/648">githubteacher</a> I sorted out my merge conflicts and able to merge my work into the development branch. My confidence boosted a little during this sprint because I completed some tasks which two weeks back I would have never thought of doing it.</p><br>

                        <h3 class="h3">What could I have done better?</h3>           
                        <p class="p">May be rather than waiting for help from team members I could have approached Elise or Martin a little earlier could have saved me a bit of time.</p><br>
                        
                        <h3 class="h3">What lessons did I learn?</h3>           
                        <p class="p">The biggest lesson I learnt in this sprint was not to depend on someone else. I learnt I need to expand my search/learning and don't be afraid to implement what I have learned to my work. I waited for my team to help me fixing the merge conflict I was having for too long. I need to back up myself and be more confident.</p><br>

                        <h3 class="h3">What barriers did I encounter?</h3>           
                        <p class="p">Motivation and time management. I think I tried my best, but due to the workload, Covid-19, and the computer issues I had definitely felt little less productive.</p><br>
