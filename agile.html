    <h1 class="h1">Agile</h1><br>
    <h2 class="h2">My personal agile evidence</h2>
    <p class="p">Before I started this semester I never used agile in my work or if I did then I never noticed it. My first impression of agile was its another development method. Later working with my team through sprints and following the lectures given to us by Martin and Ellise and my further learning of agile, I learnt agile is relating to or denoting a method of project management, used especially for software development, that is characterized by the division of tasks into short phases of work and frequent reassessment and adaptation of plans. Its an interactive approach to the project management and software development that will help my team and me to deliver value to our client faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of the grand launch at the end of the project we as an agile team will deliver our work in small, but consumable, increments. <br> 
    <br> We used agile methods throughout our SE semester as an individual and also as being a team member. Myself and my team responded to the unpredictability of constructing software. We used incremental, iterative work sequences known as sprints. We all as a team did 7 sprints for our software engineering paper. Start of the semester we worked on key agile concepts. We as a team in consultation with our client created user stories, so we could divide the work into functional increments. We followed the process of three <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/three-cs/#q=~(infinite~false~filters~(postType~(~'page~'post~'aa_book~'aa_event_session~'aa_experience_report~'aa_glossary~'aa_research_paper~'aa_video)~tags~(~'three*20cs))~searchTerm~'~sort~false~sortDirection~'asc~page~1)">C's</a>. Card-Conversation-Confirmation.
    <br><br> I created cards for the user stories along with the help of other team members. Throughout our sprints with our client, we had a conversation about the features further needed to be applied to our software product. Finally the third C-confirmation of the feature being implemented and applied to the working software. There is a very good read on the 3C's explained very well by Ron Jefferies  <a href="https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/expcardconversationconfirmation/">Essential XP</a>. The next concept is daily meetings, we as a team decided we will have 2 SCRUM meetings every week along with work together in the class and also will have client meetings every week to keep the client updated with the delivery of the working software. Each team member briefly described the contribution towards the project or if they get any obstacles like most times team members had another paper assignment and exams as well. We followed the SCRUM's 
<a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/three-qs/#q=~(infinite~false~filters~(postType~(~'page~'post~'aa_book~'aa_event_session~'aa_experience_report~'aa_glossary~'aa_research_paper~'aa_video)~tags~(~'three*20questions))~searchTerm~'~sort~false~sortDirection~'asc~page~1)">Three Questions</a> process. We applied the “daily stand-up”. This kept us motivated throughout the semester and I felt like taking charge as a leader in the meeting by starting the meeting. I also set up all the meetings as explained in my sprints. This helped us while we went though the long lockdown where we used Discord/Teams to share our screens and voice channel always on. Our sprint retrospective was set every two weeks where we all team members along with the client talk about the significant events/changes have occurred since the previous meeting, and took decisions on aiming at improvement. All our sprint retrospective can be found <a href="https://github.com/SoftEnOP/op-stats-chicken-wings/projects">here</a>. <br><br>

<a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/">Agile</a> is the ability to create and respond to change. It is a way of dealing with, and ultimately succeeding in, an uncertain and turbulent environment. This semester is indeed an uncertain and turbulent environment as we started the semester in class, then due to the lockdown we all had to complete our studies and everything from home. There were ups and downs through this period but I can confidently say I have achieved a lot this semester using/following agile principles. I have also followed the agile manifesto values. Every sprint end, I have managed to produce a working feature I was assigned to do. I collaborated well with the customer when required and also took feedback from the customer. I have responded to the change as mentioned in my sprints and also in the agile principle below. </p><br><br>

    <p class="p">Agile principles can be found <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/">here</a>.  
    Below are the agile principles I used/applied to my project work.</p><br><br>    

    <h3 class="h3">Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.</h3>
    <p class="p">The first agile principle. I made sure I followed this rule throughout the semester as I felt this is the most important rule as we should always have the working software to present to the client. I made sure the features I had been assigned for the sprint are working for our client meetings. It was quite satisfying for me when my client complemented my work by saying "good work", "excellent" and "I really like what you have done" in almost all the sprints. In sprint 5 I couldn't achieve all the tasks requested by our client but in the end I had some features working. In sprint 5 where we all as a team tried to work on the friends list, but couldn't get it working I completed the feature/task health guru tips which my client really liked and appreciated how my applied guru tips were very useful. Our client always told us at the end of the meeting that he is really happy for the efforts we have put in for the tasks he requested and quite a few times he gave us a motivational pump by saying we are the best team. I certainly felt proud of my work and felt more motivated in the hard times.</p><br><br>

    <h3 class="h3">Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.</h3>
    <p class="p">This rule best implies to us when we went into the lockdown. It was a very quick move and everything went online/remotely. At the start it was hard to adopt, but slowly with practice, I adopted tot he change along with my other teammates. During the semester I worked on a feature forgot password and I had it working in sprint 3 and my client was really impressed with the efforts I put in. I had also put in extra efforts as I also a very tough few weeks into the lockdown as my computer broke down and due to lockdown I had a lot of issues but I managed to get it working. Due to the lack of deploying of our website regularly when we deployed our website somehow the feature stopped working. I had actually asked my team to get the whole deployment earlier, but they all decided to do it a day before our presentation. Due to very small time frame team decided to take this feature out. For me personally I had to apply this agile rule. This was for me (team) an ethical decision to not go ahead with my feature I worked on.</p><br><br>

    <h3 class="h3">Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.</h3>
    <p class="p">I have delivered the working software frequently. Every sprint retrospective I had something working to show to my client. All my sprint retrospective can be found <a href="https://github.com/SoftEnOP/op-stats-chicken-wings/projects">here</a>. In sprint 5 we as a whole team couldn't get the friends list feature working, but I did manage to deliver other feature I worked on.</p><br><br>

    <h3 class="h3">Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.</h3>
    <p class="p">This will be a real challenge to implement what I have achieved in this semester. This rule should be a common practice. If I put Grayson as a business person (client) an myself as a developer hen I think I have achieved this agile principle really good. We as a team have worked together with our client throughout this project through client meetings (sprints).</p><br><br>
    
    <h3 class="h3">Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.</h3>
    <p class="p">I think all my team members did a great job applying to this agile principle. This semester we went through a lot of changes and some hard/tough decisions but they all kept motivated. If someone was down I used our chat to send jokes to cheer them up. We as a team had few concerns as to when to Work together. Some comparatively free at different times of the day to others so kind of let everyone works on the task they got in their own time. Overall, I am proud of this team. From the start, we all got along really well. This could be the fact that three of us already worked together on previous projects/assignments. We all trusted each other and we got a very good working software We presented to the teachers and the whole class.</p><br><br>

    <h3 class="h3">The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.</h3>
    <p class="p">This rule was very effective when we were all able to physically attend the class, but it all changed due the Covid-19 as we went into long lockdown and face-to-face stopped. As described in my sprints on how I an we as a team managed to communicate with each other was Online through Teams/Discord with having voice calls and sharing our screens to each other.  Also, we had to implement the style with our client meetings. All our communication was online due to the pandemic. This wasn't the best way, but somehow we manage to make it work. I can say that I attended every single team meeting, client meetings and lectures while other teammates missed some due to other personal circumstances.</p><br><br>

    <h3 class="h3">Working software is the primary measure of progress.</h3>
    <p class="p">I think I misunderstood this principle. I thought I was delivering functional/working software for my client. I had an impression that having a working software on my local machine was following this principle but I was wrong. I thought me showing my features to client every sprint finish and customer approving my work was me meeting this principle, but when our lecturers pointed out towards the end of the semester made me realize I was wrong. I think the whole team had the same mind set on this principle. I did say this to my team that we should have our changes pushed on to the mariaDB server but it was never done. When in the end we actually had our website deployed, we had quite a few issues. If I (team) should have followed this rule Earlier then we shouldn't have had too many issues in the end. We always had our changes merged to the deployment branch so I thought it wouldn't be a big issue to have it pushed to the master branch. This project has definitely taught me to that all the working software should be pushed to master branch within short time frames. By doing that we can fix issues step by Step rather than am fixing all of them at the end. By doing this we could have broken our live website further.</p><br><br>

    <h3 class="h3">Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</h3>
    <p class="p"> For this agile principle I have constantly produced a working software features during the whole semester. There was a little hiccup for me in the concentration in sprint three where we went remotely due to Covid-19 and I had computer issues but managed to get out of it really quickly. I felt this was like running a marathon and not 100mtr sprint, I had to keep up the speed, but not run too fast that I exhaust myself.</p><br><br>

    <h3 class="h3">Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.</h3>
    <p class="p">Attention to technical excellence is making the agile process working better. Technical excellence can make the development process more flexible. I think we applied this principle in our last week. We as a team all went through every aspect of our website and found few broken features. We as a team decided to get these features out so our website Follow this agile rule and not have something broken while presenting it.</p><br><br>

    <h3 class="h3">Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.</h3>
    <p class="p">I adapted to this principle in all my sprints. In some sprints when I had a lot of work load (other assignments and tests in the week) I managed to develop this project just enough to get the job done.</p><br><br>

    <h3 class="h3">The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.</h3>
    <p class="p">I believe I followed this principle quite well. I organized a lot of communication within the team. In our meeting Jonas was the main person who would start the client meeting, but I always took over the discussions with the client. In our presentation, I also took over every time any of my team members stopped while showing their features and explained a little Further. In our client meeting, I always asked for client's approval rather than telling the client as in the end, we only do this because the client wanted us to do. As a team this rule was well done. Towards the end of the semester our team spent a lot of time working on our overall website.</p><br><br>

    <h3 class="h3">At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.</h3>
    <p class="p">We had SCRUM meetings a few times a week where we all covered SCRUM's <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/three-qs/#q=~(infinite~false~filters~(postType~(~'page~'post~'aa_book~'aa_event_session~'aa_experience_report~'aa_glossary~'aa_research_paper~'aa_video)~tags~(~'three*20questions))~searchTerm~'~sort~false~sortDirection~'asc~page~1)">Three Questions</a>. We had a client sprint meeting every second Monday where we displayed our features of the working software to our client. I think I personally have applied this agile principle quit regularly throughout this semester. From the start of this semester to the end, I see myself self-improved, process-improved, my skills have advanced on my technique and how to tackle/handle the task has improved.</p><br>
