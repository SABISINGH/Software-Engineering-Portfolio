                            What a semester this has been. My last sprint of software engineering. I feel so energized, proud and confident of what I have achieved. I feel like this paper had prepared me for the projects in my final year. I have a few professional achievements in this sprint. Some of them are related to the project and some I will be discussing What I did for my portfolio webpage. This week we didn't have any tasks given from our client. We had to put everything together we did so far in our semester and get our final project working on a live platform (MariaDB). We worked on getting all the bugs fixed and added extra features Following user usability, security, UX collective aspects in mind. In our team meeting we discussed the bugs we found by going through every single page and every single feature.</p><br>  
                            <p class="p">I gave myself another challenge this semester. I backed myself that I will achieve it. I decided to make my own website for my portfolio instead of using someone's else skeleton. Most of the class I have spoken to is using someone else's skeleton site and putting their work on it. There are free jekyll themes like <a href="https://jekyllthemes.io/free">Free Jekyll themes</a> and <a href="https://jekyllthemes.io/github-pages-themes">GitHub Pages themes</a>, <a href="https://mobirise.com/">Mobirise</a> and many more. It's an easy option to use someone's website skeleton/theme and just put your details, but I felt I need to put all my learning so far from web1 (Ellise) and web2 (Dale) and my online learning into practice. I think I have done an excellent job doing it and very proud of my work and effort I have put in. I will talk more about how I created the contact-us page (using google) with real live notifications in the technical achievement.</p><br><br>
                            
                    <h2 class="h2">Technical achievment:</h2>
                        <p class="p">As mentioned above, this sprint we went through the whole website as a team for site enhancement and also finding and fixing any bugs we come across. Below is an image for all the cards created this sprint and I was assigned 5 individual cards and also 1 as a whole team. Like last sprint I followed the <a href="https://uxgorilla.com/nielsens-heuristics/">Visibility Of System Status</a> and <a href="https://uxgorilla.com/nielsens-heuristics/">User Control & Freedom</a> by placing the buttons and the colors easy to follow throughout the website. Like last sprint I implemented some Usability/UX properties <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">Heuristics for User Interface Design</a> and applies the rule of <a href="https://uxgorilla.com/nielsens-heuristics/">Consistency & Standards</a> by placing the primary button on left and the secondary button to the right on every page of the website. I followed some online about <a href="https://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?571">Primary & Secondary Actions</a> 
                        as reducing the visual prominence of secondary actions minimizes the risk for potential errors and further directs people toward a successful outcome. I also followed <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/buttons-placement-and-order-bb1c4abadfcb">UX Collective</a> and learnt the importance of the buttons. The <a href="https://coschedule.com/blog/social-media-buttons/">The Best Placement</a> site talks about social sharing analytics done and come up with a few ideas of the button placements. I went through a lot of online research and then implemented <a href="https://adamsilver.io/articles/where-to-put-buttons-on-forms/">Where to put buttons on forms</a>. Our website had basic green color for all the buttons and they were not incorrect place. Some pages on the left and some middle and some on the right and there was no correct spot for individual button. This makes it harder for a user as on one page they enter, submit on the left and then from memory on the next page they would click the left button thinking submit but then it would not be right if the button was cancelled or something else. This would not be correct as per Agile's 9th principle "Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility."
                        By following online help I decided to keep the primary button on left and then secondary button to its right. In this sprint I changed the whole website button layout. I am naming the primary buttons and secondary buttons in the bootstrap/css so the color and pattern will match throughout the whole website. One of my team mates worked on the delete button on the user edit page. The layout was all over the place and button was just placed under the form. I tried to add the delete button to the same form but it started to give me error as the buttons had different routes. I then created another form to place the delete button with nice bootstrap/css properties to match our site. Some pages were missing back buttons so I have also added back buttons like on calendar add an entry and also in creating an entry. All the images are provided below.</p><br><br>

                        <br><br><p class="p">On the contact us page I have implemented the real time contact us page with the help of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcTYJZPvD0E">Responsive Contact form</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv93yjdvkWI">Working Contact Form</a>. When my site is live if visitor try to contact me, I will get an email notification straightway with the message. Another feature I have added is to pass a message back to the visitor. Once the visitor fills the form they will get a notification that I have Received their request and will get back to them as soon as possible. Most of the videos/tutorial I watched stops there, but I have managed to actually make it work. I actually get the notifications along with user contact details to my email I have set up with google forms. On google docs I have all my Copy of Contact Us Responses saved to the spreadsheet if I need to recall any old contact response. I have used google script and added my email id to get the live responses as seen in the image below. I felt that was a great technical achievement I have achieved While this semester while working on my portfolio. There are few other achievements, but this one is definitely worth mentioning. 
                            Also on the same page I have added social media buttons with the help from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_social_media_buttons.asp">w3schools</a>, Under the form, below the submit button. The buttons are contact link to my Facebook page, my github page and to the project <a href="http://mariadb.ict.op.ac.nz/~segroup2/op-stats-chicken-wings/public/login">HealthNutz</a> website. </p><br><br>

                            <h2 class="h2">Personal Reflection:</h2><br>   
                        <h3 class="h3">What did I do well?</h3>           
                            <p class="p">Well, there is a lot to write what I did well. I have come across a long way as in confidence, time management, motivation and leadership. Best I did was working within a team and get the whole project working with flying colors. This semester we went through a lot. We went through the biggest hurdle (Covid-19), a lot of issues personally for me like laptop issues and having no computer to work on and then everything is online. I have managed to learn a lot this sprint and throughout the whole semester. I followed the UX-collective. I took part in the presentation and actively took over whenever my team members Were little hesitant in the speech.</p><br>
                        <h3 class="h3">What could I have done better?</h3>           
                            <p class="p">Again, like my last sprint I think towards the end of this semester I have personally improved a lot and I think I did really well. Nothing I can think of could have done better apart from what I mentioned in the barriers I have encountered below. I have come across a long way and I can see what I have learnt throughout this semester.</p><br>
                        <h3 class="h3">What lessons did I learn?</h3>           
                            <p class="p">I have learnt that if you have made a very good website doesn't mean it will be good for everyone. There are users who might have health issues like visual problems like color blindness. We have to put everyone in the picture when we are going to produce something like we did during our project. We should try to meet all the user requirements/needs if possible. We prepared well for the presentation at night before and felt we had the best presentation out of all the teams and we as a team had the confidence to go first for the presentation. I was (we were) confident with our final product to present to the lecturers and the other teams (Or in other words in the real world).</p><br>  
                        <h3 class="h3">What barriers did I encounter?</h3>           
                            <p class="p">Not a prefect fairy-tale end. Our presentation was on Thursday, so I asked my team to get the team meeting for checking the bugs and fixing last minute issues on Monday. I have stated that if in any case we end up getting some big issue to solve we will have enough time to get it fixed. Somehow the team decided to do it on Wednesday (A day before the presentation). It took us 4-6 hours to go through the bugs and all the features of our website/project. In the end, we got a big bug of password reset. I worked on this feature before and my client (Grayson) was very happy with the feature (Feature in sprint 3). Now it is not working and we ran out of time to get it fixed. So the whole team decided to take this feature out. I felt we should have had this meeting on Monday instead a day before the presentation. So for me I think we lacked in communication within the team but I assume every one was busy with workload as this was our last week of the semester. In the end, we got a very good working live website working and during the presentation I felt proud of what I have personally and the whole team has achieved.</p><br>
