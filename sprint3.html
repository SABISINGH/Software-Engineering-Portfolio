                    <h2 class="h2">Professional Achievment</h2>
                        <p class="p">A lot of achievements this sprint and few setbacks for me during this lockdown sprint. Personally, it was not so good for me as my motivation was very low. I have a lot of health problems and having a chronic injury, it was very, very hard for me to keep going with such physical and mental pressure but I managed to achieve a lot during this Sprint. I had to install windows <a href="https://windows.php.net/download">PHP</a>, node js from their <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">node.js</a> website. Then I had to install <a href="https://getcomposer.org/?ref=morioh.com">composer</a> and by following the instructions on the <a class="aa" href="https://laragon.org/docs/index.html">laragon website</a> and instructions on <a class="aa" href="https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@riyo.s94/laragon-how-to-install-and-using-it-for-local-development">steemit</a> A website I managed to install the Laragon on a new PC by myself. It was a great hassle to do everything again, but in the end, I felt it was a great personal achievement for me. I have explained more below on why I had to do all this again. 
                            This sprint I had to set up the forgot password functionality. I used the <a href="https://mailtrap.io/">Mailtrap</a> version for testing and it was something I have learned for the first time by myself. Half way through this sprint my laptop broke down. I was working on it until 6am doing my networking assignment and then I slept because I had class at 8am. After 2 hours sleep when I woke up my laptop didn't turn on. The screen started playing with me. I attended the whole Webex meeting on my iPhone, which was little weird, but in the end, I felt it was an achievement as I didn't let myself down and kept my morale up. Halfway though the sprint my laptop stopped working. I have explained it more in the barrier section below. New PC means I had to install everything again. Every time I downloaded and installed Laravel on the computer I end up having issues. I didn't have these issues when I installed it on my laptop. I have added errors images below. I have Asked Issa to help me with the error issues.                      
                            We tried a lot of different options like changing user privilege settings and making current user active as I thought it might be authorization issues. I have added error images below. I read somewhere that may be my anti-virus (Total AV) was not letting the file to install. I then turned off my antivirus and also windows defender Off and then reinstalled it. It worked this time. This was a very big personal achievement for me as everything was going wrong for me at this stage but I kept myself motivated by watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfWgThjXpXo">Motivation</a> videos in my own language and also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYkTbi8MCv8">ZERO Motivation</a> in english language as I really wanted myself motivated. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM7lo1faE0k">JUST KEEP STUDYING! - Study Motivation</a> video really helped me throughout this sprint.</p><br>

                    <h2 class="h2">Technical Achievment</h2>
                        <p class="p">There are few technical achievements I achieved in this sprint. I worked on the login page for this sprint. I worked on the RememberMeForgetMe branch in GitHub. I added functionality to remember me button. By following video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-MK7Y3GDuQ">Youtube</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48724256/laravel-reset-password-link">Stack </a>Overflow, I also added The forgot password button and its functionality. I encountered an issue while working on a login page. When I was on forgot your password page and registration page I could see the navigation bar with all the details. I added the noBar layout I manage to fix the navigation panel, but by doing that I end up having the weird look of the logo and app header name as per the pictures below. I kept it like that as of now because my main priority was sending the reset password link to the customer email and then allowing customer to reset the password. By following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQkhoBxyOjM">Youtube</a> Video on how to create forgot password I manage to send the email link to customers' email. This was the first time I had Worked on the vendor files and config files and it was a great learning for me. 
                            For testing purpose I used the <a href="https://mailtrap.io/">Mailtrap</a> as it is safe email testing for staging and development. Once I sent the link to the customer I looked the email css properties were very basic. I have edited the properties and made them look better and even matched it with HealthNutz website theme.</p><br>

                    <h2 class="h2">Personal Reflection:</h2><br>   
                        <h3 class="h3">What did I do well?</h3>           
                    <p class="p">Getting the reset password link, email reaching users private email inbox was a big achievement for me after having so many issues in this sprint. I think I have actually done very well. I still haven't configured the email link coming back to the site server for reset password confirmation but my client was very happy with what I have achieved in this sprint and when client approved my work with excellence and great work remarks actually made me more confident. As the 1st agile manifesto principle my client was happy and satisfied with my software delivery. A client asked me to put the link resetting password for the next sprint. I organized/arranged the scrum meeting through calendar and Also set up the meeting time for the whole team to make the deployment of our website together so we are as a team all know how to get our site deployed. We decided one person will share the screen of discord and work on it while others watch and give their feedback. As previously me and Jonas have deployed our website together in class as a team, we all decided that one of us Can get this part done.
                        I couldn't have done it as I didn't have a working PC as my laptop was broken and also joined the meeting through my iPhone Jonas took over while we talked through step by step deployment process. Once we deployed our live version we had an issue with the calendar page. It was breaking up every time we click the calendar tab in the navigation bar. One of the team member was responsible for the calendar but he came up with a few issues which he discussed with the client and put it on the backlog. I think there was an issue with target/activities not getting Linked/merged into the calendar. A team member suggested dropping the target table for the calendar to work and then migrate the target table again. By doing this we got the basic calendar displaying on our website, but now our target table was broken and it was not migrating. Our live website was broken which is not really a good practice to show a broken feature to the Client. We were not following some of the agile principles's like the 1st principle "continuous delivery of valuable software" and also the 7th principle "Working software is the primary measure of progress" by not having a delivery of the working software as our live site was broken. I noticed there was no timestamps in the target table. I added the timestamps to the target table.</p><br>

                        <h3 class="h3">What could I have done better?</h3>           
                            <p class="p">Definitely should have saved my work on another device like USB, hard disk or pushed it to get-up or even to my gitlab account. Have done it now as per the images below. I tried merging my branch to development branch and had merged conflicts. I should have asked for help from Elise.</p><br>

                        <h3 class="h3">What lessons did I learn?</h3>           
                            <p class="p">The biggest lesson I learnt during this sprint was to always save your work on multiple devices/locations as you never know what could go wrong. For me, pretty much everything went wrong half way through this sprint. Also learnt to Keep notes/workload when you install new hardware/software because then you can go back and follow the instructions If something goes wrong. Do not depend on others like I did for merging issues. I waited for Jonas as he offered to help me, but nothing happened even after asking the team multiple times. If I make mistakes (GitHub or software installation) try to fix it and if can't then I should ask Elise for help (For me this is the lesson learnt for life. It will also be helpful for me throughout this paper). As Elise said to me once that if I don't Make mistakes, then how will I learn how to fix them. This is the time I should make mistakes and learn from them.</p><br>  
                            <p class="img"><a><img border="1" src="proof/sprint3/IMG_2746.PNG" class="imgg" width="350px" height="300px"></a> <a><img border="1" src="proof/sprint3/IMG_2988.JPG" class="imgg" width="350px" height="300px"></a></p><br><br>
                        
                        <h3 class="h3">What barriers did I encounter?</h3>           
                            <p class="p">I encountered few barriers in this sprint. Working full time in my second week of holidays made it very hard and being in lockdown the pressure piled up on me. I also support my family so taking time off work is not an option for me and also I need this job as it pays for the bread and butter for me and my family. I was falling behind in all my studies during This stage. I felt I was locked within myself and couldn't get out of the stress, pressure and tension. I was weakened, tired, exhausted and fatigued.<br> 
                                I spoke to myself saying after all this, what else could go wrong and then it happened. My laptop broke down and I felt like everything has been taken away from me. I can't do anything and I will do bad in this paper and All my other papers. I had no other computer to work with and couldn't get my laptop fixed because of the lockdown. I have added the video below along with other images as proof. I tried contacting Harvey Norman and after continuous requests and calls they put me through to their Australian tech support to get this issued looked into. After a few days of struggle they said It's not a software problem and they can't get into my laptop as I can't see the screen and can't allow them access. So I was advised the laptop needs to go into the branch and they will physically look at the laptop. I tried connecting my laptop to tv, another monitor as advised by Rob but no luck. I even drove to my team mate's house (Issa) as he had DVI cable which I wanted to try Connecting an old monitor with my laptop (was hoping screen sharing might fix the issue temporarily). I know I broke the lockdown rule by going out, but I had no other option as I was panicking that I wouldn't be able to do anything during this sprint and I didn't want to let my team down. Being in lockdown and going to tech shops wasn't possible as they were all closed.
                                I was stuck with no computer to work with for over a week and all my work was on the laptop including work for my other papers. I was lucky enough that my kind next door neighbor has let me use her computer until I get my laptop fixed. She is also working from home and was given another PC from her work.
