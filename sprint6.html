        <h1 class="h1">Sprint 6</h1><br>
                    <h2 class="h2">Professional achievment</h2>
                        <p class="p">As a professional achievement this sprint was one of the best sprints I had. I picked a big topic of creating an admin profile. I went through a lot of different videos on YouTube and also I learnt a lot through the google websites and manage to put everything together. Like last sprint We all as a team worked on the friend list/group functionality for a user account. I implemented some Usability/UX properties <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">Heuristics for User Interface Design</a> by implementing <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/videos/usability-heuristic-system-status/">Visibility of system status</a> by asking the admin if they really want to go ahead with the action and then advising them when it's completed along with the color style,
                        and also <a href="https://uxgorilla.com/nielsens-heuristics/">Error Prevention</a> and <a href="https://uxgorilla.com/nielsens-heuristics/">Consistency & Standards</a> as I have allocated all by buttons on the left side with right color choice. I have implemented what I have learnt from Elise in our lectures and with the help of bootstrap I applied <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/content/tables/">Tables</a> and <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/">Alerts</a>, Learnt how to make tables and apply colors and also apply the flash messages with different colors. I was quite nervous as this topic was quite as big but it Was only me working on it. How I manage to achieve this, I will explain in the technical achievement. In the end I also had Git issues Which explains in personal reflection below.
                        I manage to sort the conflict all by myself with the encouragement from Elise and what she has taught/advised I thought this semester that try making a mistake and learn from it. The whole learning actually helped With me during this sprint and manage to pull it off. I am more confident in Git use and also not scared to make mistakes and fix it.</p><br><br>  
                                                
                    <h2 class="h2">Technical achievment</h2>
                        <p class="p">As I mentioned in the professional achievement, I think I have achieved a lot of technical achievements in this sprint. Some of the videos I watched on YouTube were not even in English or a language I could understand <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4gjmoKTEAc&list=PLzBl445W4ieu3J3VfpV0hqedk8GqyD5C-">Link</a> but I manage to learn and implement from them to my project. This <a href="https://www.alexsears.com/tutorial/create-admin-interface-laravel/">website</a> was very helpful to understand what was happening behind the scenes and also the front end. Now I will write what I have implemented/added to my admin user control. Firstly, I started with role creation by setting up roles table and model by making model with -m for migration as well and Linked users to Roll. Created migration between role & user.
                            Created RolesTableSeeder and inside the table I applied truncate method tot he table so this will delete everything in the table every time the seed in done for best practice as we never want the duplication of the data. Created UserstableSeeder for users, added roles. Created 2 users For the roles and attached the roles method to the users using the attach method for my testing purposes. Created helper method on the User model to help the roles of the users an check if they have a certain role. Created new middleware to test if the user is admin and only admin can see the users and added auth.admin middleware for create-admin-interface-laravel Knows about the middleware and the routes can be protected by the specific role. I used my last year knowledge from web2 and created a Admin\\UseController resource controller. A new part I learnt this time was we can actually delete some of the functions and then let larval know that we have deleted functions through routes.
                            While I was creating the index page to show the users under manage users I learnt the onclick button event to actually ask the user again if they want to go ahead with the request and implemented the Heuristics for User Interface Design points. I have mentioned this in my professional achievements. While I was working through Use Controller and creating the editing method another very interesting part I learnt was when we redirecting the process of edit/update/delete we can actually pass the message to the user using the alerts of different colors. I have also learnt how to add the alerts from Bootstraps <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueplLEpoG8I&list=PLxFwlLOncxFJBjuZEHqaZrbbj83IRQkiz&index=8">alerts</a> site. In my destroy method I created a check for admin not allowed to edit/delete to avoid admin removing their own admin rights and lock them out of the access. I have also learnt how we can create fake users by seeding so we can practice Managing them through my admin role from
                            <a href="https://medium.com/@khunemz/php-laravel-5-database-seeding-with-faker-c7dcce5dabe2">‘faker’</a> and from <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/seeding">laravel</a> site and by doing so I saved a lot of time on doing my testing of the account. I have learnt how to use larval factory. Larval comes with a factory created in database/factories/userfactory. It doesn't attach any roles to the factory so I used afterCreating method and attached roles to it. I have learnt both ways of creating users with tinker process in the gitbah using "php artisan tinker" command and then "factory(App\user::class, 5)->create()" method. Another method was to call our factory in the useTableSeeder. After truncating the user table I have added "DB::table('role_user')->truncate();" <br> I have realized that our app can have unlimited users and having them displayed on one page could be an issue, so I wanted to add pagination to add that extra feature. I have never tried pagination before, but when I searched online for
                            <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/pagination">laravel.com</a> I learnt that it wasn't that hard. Inside my use Controller instead of having all I added paginate(10), allowing 10 users per page and just let the view now about the change by adding '$users ->links()' just after the table end. I always thought the pagination is quite hard to implement, but while I was working on my site.</p><br>

                    <h2 class="h2">Personal Reflection</h2><br>   
                        <h3 class="h3">What did I do well?</h3>           
                            <p class="p">I am really proud of myself with this sprint. This sprint was the best sprint so far for me. I was a little off at the start of this paper, but every week I have learnt something new and now I can say I am very confident and motivated to try even more. It was a big sprint for me as I took a very big challenge of creating an Admin account. In our previous sprints our client showed interest in deleting an account or making changes. I spoke to the client and asked him if he would like an admin account where the admin can operate the whole website and just like the real world app and the client was interested and asked us to implement this feature. 
                                I took over this role and manage to get everything working and in the end my client was very, very impressed with the final outcome and was out of words with the feature. It was for me a very confident feeling. The client also told the whole team that he is impressed with this feature and that with this feature our group is doing a lot better compare to other groups as none of them implemented this feature.</p><br>
                        <h3 class="h3">What could I have done better?</h3>           
                            <p class="p">I thing this sprint I did everything I could and my client was extremely satisfied. I don't think I could have done this sprint any better.</p><br>
                        <h3 class="h3">What lessons did I learn?</h3>           
                            <p class="p">The biggest lesson I have learned this sprint is if you keep your mind focused and motivated you can achieve your goals. Last sprint my motivation was little low because as a team, we couldn't finish with one of our features, but I made sure I didn't let it impact my mind this sprint and I have achieved what I wanted.</p><br>
                        <h3 class="h3">What barriers did I encounter?</h3>           
                            <p class="p">Compare to the start of the semester this time I didn't encounter any barriers. I have learnt from the past sprints and I am very pleased with the confidence I have achieved towards the end of the semester. </p><br>
